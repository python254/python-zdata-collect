# Version 2021.2
Upstream version 2021b released 2021-09-24T23:23:00+00:00

## Briefly:

This is an intermediate release that cherry-picks only the changes to Jordan and
Samoa's DST. It will not match upstream 2021b, which includes many other
changes.

## Changes to future timestamps

Jordan now starts DST on February's last Thursday. (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

Samoa no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Geoffrey D. Bennett.)
