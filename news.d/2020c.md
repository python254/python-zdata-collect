# Version 2020.3
Upstream version 2020c released 2020-10-16T18:15:53+00:00

## Briefly:

Fiji starts DST later than usual, on 2020-12-20.

## Changes to future timestamps

Fiji will start DST on 2020-12-20, instead of 2020-11-08 as previously
predicted.  DST will still end on 2021-01-17. (Thanks to Raymond Kumar and Alan
Mintz.)  Assume for now that the later-than-usual start date is a one-time
departure from the recent pattern.
