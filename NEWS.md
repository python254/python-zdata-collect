# Version 2020.1
Upstream version 2020a release 2020-04-23T23:03:47+00:00

## Briefly:

Morocco springs forward on 2020-05-31, not 2020-05-24. Canada's Yukon advanced
to -07 year-round on 2020-03-08. America/Nuuk renamed from America/Godthab. zic
now supports expiration dates for leap second lists.

## Changes to future timestamps

Morocco's second spring-forward transition in 2020 will be May 31, not May 24 as
predicted earlier.  (Thanks to Semlali Naoufal.) Adjust future-year predictions
to use the first Sunday after the day after Ramadan, not the first Sunday after
Ramadan.

Canada's Yukon, represented by America/Whitehorse and America/Dawson, advanced
to -07 year-round, beginning with its spring-forward transition on 2020-03-08,
and will not fall back on 2020-11-01.  Although a government press release calls
this "permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time", we prefer MST for consistency
with nearby Dawson Creek, Creston, and Fort Nelson. (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

## Changes to past timestamps

Shanghai observed DST in 1919.  (Thanks to Phake Nick.)

## Changes to timezone identifiers

To reflect current usage in English better, America/Godthab has been renamed to
America/Nuuk.  A backwards-compatibility link remains for the old name.

## Changes to commentary

The ÃŽles-de-la-Madeleine and the Listuguj reserve are noted as following
America/Halifax, and comments about Yukon's "south" and "north" have been
corrected to say "east" and "west".  (Thanks to Jeffery Nichols.)
